# KingOfTheMeme
This was a small project made in my freeTime during the WPI 2017 Hackathon. The game was intended to win an award based on humor which is why the project is based on memes. It was a good practice of Objected Oriented Python scripting and I encourage people to try it out if they are interested.


Instruction: For anyone running Windows, make sure that you have Python installed in your shell. Go to the directory of the project folder and type in "python game.py" in your command to run the game.
