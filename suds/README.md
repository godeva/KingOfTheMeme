# SUDS

The engine for **King of the Meme** as coded by Aaron Thomas. One day this might live in its own repo, but for now it's here. SUDS is an acronym which stands for Single User Dungeon System. It is a very basic engine designed for creating singleplayer text based names; it might also be useful for someone trying to create a MUD, although that is not the purpose of SUDS.

@todo(aaron) properly writeup what the plan is for this (what every class is vs what they has)
